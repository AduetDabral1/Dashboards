<strong>Financial Statistics</strong>
<p>This Excel dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the financial performance of a marketing agency from 2019 to 2024, with three major tables: Income Sources (shows the breakdown of the agency's revenue by income sources); Geographical Revenue/Sales (shows the agency's revenue/sales by geographic region by country); Sales Process from Income Sources (shows the sales process for each income source, including the flow of traffic to generate revenue).
The dashboards are powered by Excel pivot tables, which allow users to easily filter and analyze the data. Users can also use slicers to interact with the dashboard and drill down into specific areas of interest.</p>
